                    The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role
                    throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is in the northwest of the
                    island of Sicily, by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.

                    Palermo is an urban melting pot characterized by history and culture so diverse that it often feels
                    conflicted. Discover an intriguing range of architectural styles, from Arabian domes to baroque
                    buildings, and enjoy delicious cuisine that spans a variety of origins. Be sure to visit the Palace
                    of the Normans, the Palatine Chapel and the church of St. John of the Hermits. Art and music lovers
                    won’t want to miss the Galleria d’Arte Moderna (the “GAM”), the Salinas or an opera or ballet at the
                    Teatro Massimo.

                    In a world where so many places have become tourist-friendly to a fault, visiting Palermo is still
                    somewhat of an adventure. You won’t find many restaurants with menus translated into five different
                    languages, you may have trouble communicating in English in many places, and some parts of the old
                    town centre have remained untouched since they were bombed during the war.
